# ACE-neuro: Analysis of Calcium Imaging and Ephys

**ACE-neuro** (Analysis of Calcium Imaging and Ephys) is an integrated, object-oriented Python library designed for the systems neuroscience community. It provides high-level pipelines for processing simultaneous 1-photon calcium imaging (Miniscope) and multi-channel electrophysiology (EEG/LFP) data.

For a **class-diagram overview** of core managers and processors, see the Mermaid diagram in the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/emelon8/experiment_analysis/blob/main/README.md#system-architecture).

-   __Unified Search__
    
    Full integrated search functionality across all pipelines, guides, and API references.

-   __Multimodal Alignment__
    
    Align miniscope and ephys time bases (TTL-based or hardware-clock paths, depending on loaders) for cross-modal analysis.

-   __CNMF-E Integrated__
    
    Native wrappers around [CaImAn](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn) for optimized source extraction in micro-endoscopic data.

-   __HPC Ready__
    
    Headless mode and Slurm support built-in for high-throughput batch processing on supercomputers.

## Step-by-step tutorials

These notebooks explain **`project_path`** (folder with **`experiments.csv`** and **`analysis_parameters.csv`**) vs **`data_path`** (raw recordings), then walk each pipeline stage by stage:

- [Miniscope](notebooks/miniscope_pipeline_tutorial.ipynb)
- [Ephys](notebooks/ephys_pipeline_tutorial.ipynb)
- [Multimodal alignment](notebooks/multimodal_alignment_tutorial.ipynb)
---

## Installation

The Miniscope pipeline depends on **CaImAn** and a full scientific stack. **Do not** rely on `pip install -e .` alone unless you already have CaImAn working on your machine.

- **Full setup (recommended):** follow **[Getting started — Installation](getting_started.md#3-installation)** (conda + `linux_environment.yml` on Linux; macOS/Windows are best-effort via conda-forge).
- **Documentation builds only:** Read the Docs installs the package without CaImAn so API pages can build without the imaging stack; that environment is not sufficient to run CNMF-E locally.

For architecture, extension points, and supported acquisition formats, see **[Getting started](getting_started.md)** and **[Creating new data loaders](guides/adding_data_loaders.md)**.

---

## Tests and sample data

- **`tests/data/sample_recording/`** — Committed fixtures for factory tests and the optional slow Miniscope CNMF-E end-to-end test.
- To regenerate fixtures from a local `sample data/` tree, use `scripts/create_test_data.py` (see the [README](https://github.com/emelon8/experiment_analysis/blob/main/README.md#development-and-testing) Development and testing section).

## API Overview

ACE-neuro provides a clear, modular API optimized for both interactive use and automated scripts.

```python
from ace_neuro.pipelines.multimodal import MultimodalPipeline

# Initialize and run a synchronized analysis
api = MultimodalPipeline()
api.run(
    line_num=97,
    project_path="/path/to/project",
    data_path="/path/to/raw_data",
    headless=True  # Run without GUIs for batch processing
)
```

**Parameters:** every pipeline exposes a `run(...)` method whose arguments are **keyword-only in practice** (see docstrings). You set them via **Python kwargs**, optional **`analysis_parameters.csv`** (loaded with `load_analysis_params`), and **CLI defaults** for `python -m ace_neuro.pipelines.*`. The precedence and full pattern are spelled out under **section 5a (Passing parameters into the pipelines)** in [Getting started](getting_started.md).
